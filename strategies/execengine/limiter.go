// the engine calls Spend for EVERY placement RPC it actually issues — gated clip opens and

// FAIL-SAFE: when constructed with a window budget (NewQuotaLimiterBudget), the limiter is

// NEVER blind-permits opens (the old fail-OPEN default that let a fast burst starve a
// hedge into a naked leg). A real Set only refines the estimate; if the refresher never
// runs or dies, the self-managed budget still reserves the hedge headroom. Constructed with
// NewQuotaLimiter (no budget) it keeps the legacy behaviour: permissive until the first Set.

// Set installs the latest known remaining budget and window reset from the broker. now is

//
// Set is authoritative but not blind:
//   - A token older than the last one actually applied means this is a late, out-of-order
//     response (RefreshQuota's poll loop is strictly sequential, but a defensive guard costs
//     nothing) — ignored.
//   - A resetAt that has already passed by the time this Set arrives carries a dead number:
//     ignored, deferring to refreshWindow's self-heal on the next Allow/Spend instead of
//     adopting an already-stale window. This guard only applies in fail-safe mode
//     (windowLimit>0) — legacy mode has no self-heal to defer to.
//   - A token whose epoch is behind the CURRENT epoch means the window rolled over locally
//     (refreshWindow, from an ordinary Spend/Allow) while this RPC was still in flight — the
//     usage-metrics RPC can take up to quotaRPCTimeout, easily longer than a fail-safe
//     window's own rollover cadence near a boundary. The answer describes an already-
//     superseded window: rejected outright, not adjusted — re-subtracting ops spent in the
//     NEW window from the OLD window's remaining is meaningless arithmetic, and applying it
//     anyway would walk resetAt backwards, so the next Allow/Spend sees it as elapsed and
//     full-resets the budget, erasing every op the true, newer window already spent. (A
//     broker resetAt merely earlier than the local bootstrap GUESS, with no rollover in
//     between, is a legitimate correction — see TestQuotaLimiterSetOverridesBootstrap — so
//     resetAt comparison alone cannot be the discriminator; the epoch is.)
//   - Ops booked via Spend since token are re-subtracted from remaining: a Spend that raced
//     the metrics RPC is real and must survive.
//   - Within the SAME epoch (resetAt unchanged from the current one), the result is clamped
//     to never exceed the local view — a broker snapshot cannot un-know a spend local
//     tracking already recorded. A NEW epoch is not clamped: a fresh window's full budget
